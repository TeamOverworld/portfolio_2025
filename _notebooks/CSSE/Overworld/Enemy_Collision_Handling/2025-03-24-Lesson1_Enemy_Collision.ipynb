    "# Enemy Collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our game is already filled with different types of collision reactions with NPCs. However, in order to make our game even more challenging, we can introduce the idea of having an Enemy. Having an enemy doesn't come without its consequences. In this lesson, you will learn how to create consequences when our player collides with an enemy. "

    "### Creating an Enemy\n",
    "In order to make our enemy, we decided to create a new class for it. We made a new .js file titled 'Enemy.js'. Like the other aspects of our game, this allows us to store all the functions for the enemy and create consequences for collisions without making a mess of our code. We extended this class from our character class. There it is:\n",

    "Having the enemy be its own special case file is important because it allows for the enemy to be able to restart the game and have the player die. It being its own class allows it to have special consequences that affect the gameplay.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "This file is very similar to the NPC.js except in this case, it creates a way for something to happen when the player and enemy collide with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the very beginning of the file, it checks if the player is destroyed (`this.playerDestroyed = false`) and we set it to false so that it can be changed to true later on in the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then it goes to collisionChecks which simply checks if the enemy is colliding with the player. If the player is collided with the enemy then `this.collisionData.hit` returns true because the player and the enemy are colliding. If its true, a `handleCollisionEvent` occurs, which runs the things that happen when they are collided.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We used `console.log` to print a message after they collide\n",
    "* `this.playerDestroyed = false` is changed to `this.playerDestroyed = true`, what we were talking about in the beginning player should be 'dead'\n",
    "* `this.gameEnv.gameControl.restartLevel()`; this one's more complicated as you had to create a function inside of gameControl that restarts the level. We are simply just recalling it.\n"
